#! /bin/bash


# To use:
# Download the zip file you submitted on KEATS and the script below.
# Start the itr container.
# Go to the directory where your zip file is.
# Run the script as follows:

# bash student_aa_run_tester.sh <FILE NAME>.zip <VIDEO PATH> <YOLO_COCO_DATA_PATH>

# Where <FILE NAME> is the name of your file (i.e., $PACKAGE_NAME.zip), 
# and <VIDEO PATH> is the full path to the folder where the videos are located.
# <YOLO_COCO_DATA_PATH> is the full path to the yolo coco data folder.

# Once you run this, a new workspace will be created in /tmp, catkin_make will be run,
# permissions will be set, the workspace will be sourced, and the launchfile will be called.
# If you see Rviz and your code runs without errors, it should also run on our computer. 
# Emphasis is on the should; if something fails in our computer and we cannot run it, we cannot amend this. However, if the script works, this should be a good indicator that the code will also work on our test machine.
